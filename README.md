# Airline-Analysis-using-NetrowkX-in-python
In this project, we were given a csv file named routes.txt which contained all the data of airlines with the airline id, airport source, destination etc. 
We will be working in python using networkx do find out various graph characteristics like diameter, connectivity, degree in order to find out 
the busiest, most important and the next potential hubs for the airlines.
I have uploaded 2 files, one in .py and other in .ipynb.
You can run the file in google colab for the best results.
Make Sure to install the networkx library.
